                </div>
                <div id = "about-text">Hi, my name is Jonathan Chu and I am a 2nd year EECS student at UC Berkeley. For most of my life, I grew up in Southern California in the city of Arcadia, which resides in the San Gabriel Valley. Through my experiences at Arcadia High School, I developed a passion for music, and in particular, percussion. While on Arcadia High's percussion team, we placed 5th overall at the 2013 Winterguard International Percussion Championships for our indoor percussion. Percussion taught me to strive for perfection and constant improvement, two things that have carried over to my studies in school as well. My second passion grew out of my experiences with people I met at UC Berkeley. It was here that I was introduced to photography and photo-editing, and I hope to constantly improve my photo-taking skills. I especially love taking photos of scenery because it reminds me of how I want to travel the world some day. I like seeing new things and remembering places I've been to. To me, a perfect photo is priceless.</div>
